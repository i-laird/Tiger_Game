# Basic Guidelines

- Don't work on other people's branches (without communicating with them)
- Make all changes in Visual Studio 2017 or a plain text editor for consistency
- If you're adding something, create new branch off of develop that begins with your name
- Don't just merge branches; create a pull request to develop and then everyone else can review your code
- Feel free to add to this Readme.md or the Theory.md file as much as you want
